## Money Talks in Politics

Money Talks in Politics is an application designed to display publicly released financial details based on committees representing major political figures when they were running for office in 2016. This application is also a forum to allow users to submit comments and about each graphic representation.

### Intended User Workflow

The intended use for this app was initially purely for data visualization. As development continued, I considered creating a comment section, which required a user register/login.

### Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* HTML5/CSS
* React
* Material UI
* Firebase/Firestore

### What's to come?
* Improve comment section by providing comments only for specific candidates
* Additional charts
* Adding modal descriptions for each chart
* Delve further into the API for more detailed measurements
